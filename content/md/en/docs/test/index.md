The topics in this section highlight tools and techniques for testing your blockchain logic.

- [Unit test](/test/unit-testing) explains how you can use the Rust testing framework and a mock runtime environment to execute unit tests that validate individual functions or modules of code.
- [Debug](/test/debug) describes how you can use the Rust logging functions to debug your runtime.
- [Benchmark](/test/benchmark) explains the role of benchmarks, how you can use the benchmarking framework to evaluate the performance of the function calls in your code and to adjust transaction weight to accurately reflect execution time.
