- [Connect a local parachain](/tutorials/connect-relay-and-parachains/connect-a-local-parachain/) highlights the steps necessary to connect your local parachain to a relay chain.
- [Acquire a testnet slot](/tutorials/connect-relay-and-parachains/acquire-a-testnet-slot/) summarizes the steps for connecting a parachain to the Rococo test network.
